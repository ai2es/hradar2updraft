# Scripts

### What is in here? 

There are a bunch of scripts in here that were used in the process of this paper. The goal is is not to provide runable code (because I cannot spend the time to containerize all the code to run on the cloud/on everyones specific machine), but to be transparent with the scripts that were needed in processing/making/analyzing the data in this paper. 

Feel free to use these scripts to help you with your own models and training sessions. 

Example of how to call a training session: 

`` python -u hparams_updraft_3dconv.py --logdir="/PATH/TO/LOGS/" ``
